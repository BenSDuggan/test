Setup Guide
===========

There are two seporate things that need to be setup: the server (Raspberry Pi) and RFID readers.  It's a good idea to understand how the system works before trying to install it.  The :ref:`overview<overview>` gives a good explination of this.  Both of the setups can be done on windows, Mac or Linux but a basic understanding of Linux or commandline tools will be helpful for the Raspberry Pi setup.
